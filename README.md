<h1 align="center">JavaScript API Projects</h1>

A collection of mini-projects demonstrating **API concepts** in JavaScript.  
These projects were built while following a learning series on APIs, and they serve as practical exercises to solidify key concepts.

## ðŸ”¹ What's Inside
- **Fetch API Basics** â€“ Making GET, UPDATEe, DELETE and POST requests
- **REST API Integration** â€“ Working with public APIs
- **JSON Handling** â€“ Parsing and using JSON data
- **Async/Await & Promises** â€“ Writing clean asynchronous code
- **Error Handling** â€“ Gracefully handling API errors
- **Mini Apps** â€“ Small projects that consume real-world data (e.g., weather app, quote generator)

## ðŸ”¹ Goal
The main goal is to **practice and reinforce API-related concepts** through small, focused projects that gradually increase in complexity.

## ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack
- **Language:** JavaScript (ES6+)
- **APIs:** Various public REST APIs
- **Tools:** Fetch API, Promises, async/await
